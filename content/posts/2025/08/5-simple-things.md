title: '5 simple things you can do to make your in-person events more neurodivergent-friendly'
---
Unfamiliarity and ambiguity are two things that many neurodivergent folk really struggle with. New and unpredictable places and events can cause a whole lot of anxiety. But there are plenty of simple (and cheap) things you can do to reduce the ambiguity and allow us the accommodations we need to feel more comfortable and to reduce anxiety ahead of and at the event:

1. Clarity, clarity and more clarity! You really can't give too many details about what is going to happen. Think agendas, timetables, maps, invitee lists, descriptions of any activities etc. If possible, video tours, photos, floor plans or maps of new locations are ideal - nothing is too much detail but at a minimum it's great to know where entrances and toilets are, as well as any calmÂ / quiet spaces we can retreat to if we feel overwhelmed.

2. Providing the above-mentioned quiet / calm / low sensory input spaces, which should be easily (and inconspicuously) accessible. Think privacy, quiet, low lighting, soft seating, sensory aids. Ideally, get your neurodivergent team members' input into what would work best for them to create a safe space.

3. Consider timing of the event. Ideally many of us want to avoid travelling at peak times. Public transport can be a sensory and executive function nightmare but I personally also find driving to new places very stressful. If possible, plan events to enable us to travel outside of rush hour.

4. Please don't 'ish' us! I struggle with the ambiguity of phrases like "be there for 5ish", "the dress code is formal-ish" (don't get me started on business casual!) or "don't worry, it'll be quiet-ish in there". Be specific where possible!

5. If there's going to be food, please share a menu beforehand so we know what to expect and can plan ahead. The previously mentioned quiet space would be amazing if available at meal times as well as eating around others can often be overwhelming.
It's also useful to consider the genuine need for attendance at in-person events, and ensure they are clearly signposted as mandatory or optional. With any socialising or optional in-person events, give us a get-out pass. We don't want to never be invited to things, but I know that I feel much better if I know I can get away early if I need to and it's not going to draw lots of comments or disapproval.

With a bit of thought and consideration, you can make events inclusive and accessible for everyone.
