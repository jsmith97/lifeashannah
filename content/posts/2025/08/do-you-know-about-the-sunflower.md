## The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower

The sunflower represents hidden disabilities and you may spot people wearing it on a lanyard, wristband or pin badge.

Hidden disabilities are just that - not always obvious just from looking at someone.

People may use the [**Hidden Disabilities Sunflower ðŸŒ»**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hidden-disabilities/) to signal that they have a disability, condition or chronic disease that affects them, their life and their needs, but may not be immediately obvious to others around them.

There is no exhaustive list of these disabilities and they are diverse in nature - fromÂ Autism to Arthritis, Epilepsy to MS, and hundreds more besides.

The reasons someone may choose to wear a sunflower differ, and so do the support needs and access requirements those people may have.

People may wish to share the details of their condition, but equally there is no need for them to.

In general, people wear the sunflower lanyard to indicate to those around them that they may need extra help, time or understanding in the situation they are in.

It's common for people to use them in busy public spaces like airports, supermarkets and shopping centres, when using public transport or accessing other support services.

Shops, services and businesses may also use signs to indicate they are 'sunflower friendly' spaces.

## ðŸŒ» My Sunflower Story ðŸŒ»

For me, travel is hard. Public transport is something that I often find tricky, especially travelling somewhere new to me, at busy times or if things change last minute (thank you, British rail companies!).

Busy public spaces like airports, supermarkets and shopping centres are also places I often struggle, especially if I'm alone. I easily get overwhelmed in these situations and that is compounded by the fact that I worry how my behaviour may be misinterpreted if I experience autistic meltdowns of shutdowns in spaces like these. People often don't understand an autistic person in distress and this can lead to uncomfortable or even unsafe situations.

So being able to let people know that I may need some extra space, and that I may struggle with things for reasons that aren't immediately obvious, is very useful and helps me feel safe.

So, if you spot that someone is wearing the sunflower, be aware they may need a little extra time, a little extra space, a little extra care.

Not sure what to do or say?

That's ok.

Just ask how you can help.

And be kind. ðŸ’›
